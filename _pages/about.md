Hi, I'm **Qian Dai (ä»£ä¹¾)** â€” a Robotics M.S. student at The University of Hong Kong, focused on applying AI to healthcare.  
I hold a B.Eng. in Software Engineering from Fudan University, and I'm deeply interested in building intelligent medical systems that improve patient care.

### Research Interests

- AI for medical diagnostics and wearable health devices  
- Motion analysis, rehabilitation, and biomechanics  
- Multimodal learning and health-oriented ML

### Current Project

I'm currently working on evaluating the reliability and stability of a portable motion capture device for ankle joint assessment using ICC, DTW, and Blandâ€“Altman analysis.

### Future Direction

Iâ€™m preparing to pursue a PhD in biomedical AI and hope to contribute to smarter, more accessible healthcare through robotics and data-driven modeling.
